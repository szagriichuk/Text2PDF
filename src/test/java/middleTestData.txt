Let me just start by saying that one thing I
learned while traveling the country this past
summer '06 is how to rely on instincts and
how to trust people, because in most
circumstances in life, whether it can be
realized or not, trust in yourself and others
around you is all you can really depend on.
Physical comfort is only necessary when it's
needed; beyond that, life is emotional, political,
and not always desirable..
Emotions and various other subjective
understandings about life determine who
we are, what we do, how we act, and our
future. On that note, it is important that you,
as the reader, understand that my stories are
half-emotion, half-fact, but mostly I want to
share the things I've learned about
relationships,
travel,
gender dynamics,
actual poverty vs.
chosen poverty
